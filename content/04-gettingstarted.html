<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>A lot of projects? Let's put the pieces together:</p>
<h2>The user story</h2>

...

<h2>Setting up your environment</h2>
<p>Installing the different FlatTurtle projects is easy. Each repository has its
own installation instructions that can be followed step by step. You can find the links to the relevant pages in
the <a href="#projects">projects</a> section above.</p>

<div class="well">
    <p>To make it possible for the FlatTurtle projects to work together you need
    to use <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/">virtual hosts</a>.
    This way you can define local urls for each project like <code>http://myturtle.local</code>. Do not forget to add these server names to your hosts file (location dependent on OS) and do not forget to update the project specific configuration files to use the urls of your local instances.</p>
