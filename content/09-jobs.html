<h1>Jobs</h1>
<p>As you can see, we still have a lot of open issues on <a href="http://github.com/FlatTurtle" target="_blank">github</a>. Do these issues look like challenges you can handle? <a href="mailto:jobs@flatturtle.com">Mail us</a> your CV!</p> 
<p>We like:
  <ul>
    <li>to work with people who already played with our codebase*, they know what they are up to,
    <li><strong>freelancers</strong> who can solve custom requests,
    <li>spontaneous solicitations for full or parttime positions and
    <li>people who dislike bullet points such as <strong>graphic designers</strong> and <strong>information architects</strong>.
  </ul>
</p>

<small>* We believe that as a developer, you should never accept a job without first seeing the code you will have to work with</small>
